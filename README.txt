Tools and Frameworks
Frontend:
      React or Blazor: Use one of these modern frontend libraries to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
      React: Offers flexibility and component-based development, widely used for fast rendering.
Carousel/Gallery:
      Swiper or Slick Carousel: These libraries provide pre-built components for displaying images in a carousel format.
      Custom Carousel: For more control over functionality and style, you can build a custom carousel using CSS transitions and JavaScript event handlers.
Backend:
      ASP.NET Core: Handle the backend logic such as URL fetching, HTML parsing, image extraction, and word count analysis.
      APIs: Expose API endpoints to fetch URLs, parse HTML content, and return data to the frontend for display.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  ********Key Feature Implementation********
	  
	  1. Image Extraction:
			HtmlAgilityPack (for .NET): This library can parse HTML, making it easy to extract image elements (<img> tags) from the provided URL.
			Handle edge cases:
			Broken URLs: Implement fallback behavior if an image fails to load.
			Relative paths: Convert relative URLs to absolute using the base URL.
			Lazy-loaded images: Detect data-src or similar attributes for images that load via JavaScript.
	  2. Word Count Analysis:
			Strip HTML tags using Regex or HtmlAgilityPack to clean the text for analysis.
			LINQ or Regex: Use these for efficiently counting word occurrences in the cleaned text.
			Visualize word count data:
					Chart.js or Highcharts: These libraries can generate charts to visualize the word count analysis.
